This paper proposes a novel methodology for short-term wind power forecasting, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this work, we evaluate the CNN ability of predicting the wind power generation by comparing it to two benchmarking methods – ARIMA and gradient boosting machine (GBM). We prove that CNN is well suited for this purpose, outperforming the other tested techniques, specially when the prediction horizon is greater than 1-hour. Besides, this paper shows that additional features like meteorological forecasts provide fruitful information, powering the CNN performance.","tags":null,"title":"Convolutional Neural Network for Short-term Wind Power Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JL Viegas","PR Esteves","SM Vieira"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"bb1d91c5f386c85d71755e6f661f51a6","permalink":"https://jqmviegas.github.io/publication/detection_ntls/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/detection_ntls/","section":"publication","summary":"The reduction of non-technical losses is a significant part of the total potential benefits resulting from implementations of the smart grid concept. This paper proposes a data-based method to detect sources of theft and other commercial losses. The proposed method works on the space of four different indicators of irregular consumption, enabling the easy interpretation of results. A use case based on real data is presented to evaluate the method. The threat model considers sixteen different possible types of changes in consumption pattern that result from non-technical losses, including attacks and defects present since the first day of metering.","tags":null,"title":"Clustering-based novelty detection for identification of non-technical losses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JL Viegas","SM Vieira","R Melício","VMF Mendes","JMC Sousa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"4c305b5764a99edb398dd43189cc5eb7","permalink":"https://jqmviegas.github.io/publication/detection_ntls_review/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/detection_ntls_review/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-technical losses occurring in the electric grid at level of transmission or of distribution have negative impact on economies, affecting utilities, paying consumers and states.

The current state of the art is extended by using a combination of smart metering and survey data and by using model-based feature selection. Firstly, the normalized representative consumption profiles of the population are derived through the clustering of data from households. Secondly, new customers are classified using survey data and a limited amount of smart metering data. Thirdly, model-based feature selection results explain the importance of the variables and which are the drivers of different consumption profiles.","tags":null,"title":"Classification of new electricity customers based on surveys and smart metering data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["CM Salgado","JL Viegas","CS Azevedo","MC Ferreira","SM Vieira","JMC Sousa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1465862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465862400,"objectID":"60a8c11f3d6599301a6a8954aa517b54","permalink":"https://jqmviegas.github.io/publication/ts_mfc/","publishdate":"2016-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ts_mfc/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose the use of mixed fuzzy clustering (MFC) algorithm to derive Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models.
